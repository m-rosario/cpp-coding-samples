This is the C++ module for a piano keyboard Android application. It handles all
aspects of digital signal processing.

It takes advantage of the https://github.com/google/oboe library to play very
low latency audio for each of the 88 piano keys. This module is meant to be
called by Android Java code via the Java Native Interface (JNI).

- `mixer` directory contains logic for sound playback.
- `effects` directory contains logic for audio manipulation and effects.
