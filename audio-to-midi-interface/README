Digital signal processing for an Audio-to-Midi Interface implemented with an
Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller.

The microcontroller is connected to a musical instrument via a 1/4 inch
connector, and to a computer via USB. Notes played on the instrument would
get converted into MIDI messages and sent to the computer, where they can be
processed by a Digital Audio Workstation.

- `SignalAnalyzer` monitors the audio signal and determines the fudamental
frequency of each note.
- `MidiEncoder` converts audio frequency and amplitude into a MIDI message, and
sends it through USB.
